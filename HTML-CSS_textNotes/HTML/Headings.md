# Heading(s)


## Purpose

The heading(s) is used to create a title or the headline of any article or paragraph.


## Theory

The HTML heading is represented by the HTML heading tag. The tag is initiated from the starting tag **'\<h1>'** and enclosed with an ending tag **'\</h1>'**. The heading-text is typed in between the two tags.

```
Syntax: <h1></h1>
```

There are total six ways of defining the heading. From 'h1' to 'h6' where, the 'h1' being the largest heading and 'h6' being the smallest heading.

```
Syntax: <h1></h1>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <h5></h5>
        <h6></h6>
```


## Example

This is the normal text.

<h1>This is heading using h1 tag</h1>
<h2>This is heading using h2 tag</h2>
<h3>This is heading using h3 tag</h3>
<h4>This is heading using h4 tag</h4>
<h5>This is heading using h5 tag</h5>
<h6>This is heading using h6 tag</h6>

> In the above example, notice the normal paragraph text as compared to all the headings below it.
