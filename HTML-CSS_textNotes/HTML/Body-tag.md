# Body Tag


## Purpose

The body tag is used to enclose the target-code which will be visible to the end user in form of webpage.


## Theory

The body tag is initiated from the starting tag **'\<body>'** and enclosed with an ending tag **'\</body>'**. The overall body's main-code is typed in between the two tags.  

The body tag contains the three major tags as a systmetic form. The header, main and footer tags.

```
Syntax:

    <body>
        <header></header>
        <main></main>
        <footer></footer>
    </body>
```
