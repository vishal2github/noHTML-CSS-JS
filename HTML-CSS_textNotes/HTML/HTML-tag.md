# HTML Tag


## Purpose

The html tag is used to enclose the overall html code.


## Theory

The HTML tag is initiated from the starting tag **'\<html>'** and enclosed with an ending tag **'\</html>'**. The overall html code is typed in between the two tags.  

The html tag majorily contains the two major tags as a systmetic form. The head, and body tags.

```
Syntax:

    <html>
        <head></head>
        <body></body>
    </html>
```
