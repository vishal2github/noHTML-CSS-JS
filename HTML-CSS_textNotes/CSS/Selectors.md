## Selectors


### Purpose

The CSS selectors are used to select the class and identity elements of the html code for implementation of several CSS rules upon them.


### Theory

To select the class element, the **period symbol '.'** is used following the class name. Similarly for the identity element, the **pound or hash sign '#'** is used following the identity name.

Some of the most common, major and well-supported CSS selectors are:

+ Element Type Selectors
+ Descandant Selectors
+ Class Selectors
+ Id Selectors
+ Child Selectors
+ Adjacent Sibling Selectors
+ Pseudo Selectors
+ Universal Selectors
